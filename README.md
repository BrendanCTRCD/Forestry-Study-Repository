# Forestry Study Repository
 This is a repository of notes that is meant to be written and read regularly both at work and at home for the purpose of studying forestry. The repository can be used in Obsidian text-editor app at home for the purpose of Zettlekastkin-style note management.

 This repository is stored locally in the CareerDevelopment folder area on my work computer.
 It can be accessed by my personal GitHub and loaded to my local home repository at home for use of study.
