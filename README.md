# Forestry Study Repository

## Purpose of Repository

 This is a repository of notes that is meant to be written and read regularly both at work and at home for the purpose of studying forestry. The repository can be used in Obsidian text-editor app at home for the purpose of Zettlekastkin-style note management.

## How this repository is stored and shared

 This repository is stored locally in the CareerDevelopment folder area on my work computer.
 It can be accessed by my personal GitHub and loaded to my local home repository at home for use of study.

## Stucture of repository
This repository will not use subfolders but will instead use many Markdown Textfiles in one folder. Each file will represent a singular idea within the concept of forestry and will have links to related ideas. Since each file is a singular idea it is considered as an "atomic note" within the concept of Zettlekastkin learning.

## Use of this repository
I will use this repository to write, store, review, and update my learning of forestry. Each day, I will study forestry by reading the study guide, suggested textbooks, and by practicing field skills, math and IDs. As I read I will summarize my learning into notes. I will regularly review the notes using a spaced repetition plug-in and update the atomic notes as needed. There is no need to silo ideas from the beginning. However, it may be helpful to make notes that are the name of a common topic with a list of notes that are within the topic.
